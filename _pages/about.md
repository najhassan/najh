I am a first year graduate student at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR. Currently, I am working at [SHI LAB @ UO](https://www.humphreyshi.com/people) tackling recent challenges of Computer Vision advised by [Prof. Humphrey](https://www.humphreyshi.com/). More recently, I have worked on segmentation, matting and transformers. I am also motivated by the smart farming dream and like to spend time on agricultural applications of computer vision. Previously, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
