I have completed my master's degree from the Department of Computer Science, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR. Currently, I am working on Generative Graph Models with [Prof Yu Wang](https://yuwang0103.github.io/). I also have worked on adversarial learning, object detection and tracking, unsupervised domain adaptation, etc. Before UO, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
